      <h5>Switzerland:-The Europe Country</h5>
      <p>
      The success behind great Swiss chocolate and cheese is the use of unpasteurized milk. This is basically raw milk. The benefits of raw milk are a better taste, better nutrition, and a healthier immune system. This is due to the conditions they raise their cows in. Farmers continue old traditions by living in the mountainside and keeping their livestock in good conditions.

Another thing Switzerland is quite famous for is their watches. Swiss watches dominate the watchmaking industry. Brands like Tag Heuer, Rolex, Rado, Omega, etc., are all Swiss brands, and they are the biggest companies in the industry, per Statista.

Banks are another thing people think of when they hear “Switzerland.” This is due to the fact that their banks are some of the safest ones regarding their privacy policy. They are known for keeping their client’s identity hidden, except in cases of terrorist threats
